This project is a Weather App built using Python and the Streamlit library, designed to provide users with current weather information for a specified city. Here’s an overview of its components, functionality, and potential improvements.

Project Overview
Purpose:

The primary aim is to allow users to input a city name and retrieve real-time weather data, including temperature, weather description, and humidity, using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Technology Stack:

Python: The programming language used to write the application logic.
Streamlit: A framework for building interactive web applications in Python. It simplifies the process of creating web apps and provides a straightforward way to display data.
OpenWeatherMap API: A third-party service that provides weather data. The app interacts with this API to fetch the weather information based on user input.
Features
User Input:

The app includes a text input box where users can type in the name of a city.
Real-Time Data Fetching:

When the user clicks the "Get Weather" button, the app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather information for the entered city.
Information Display:

The app displays the following information if available:
Temperature: The current temperature in Celsius.
Weather Description: A brief description of the weather conditions (e.g., "clear sky").
Humidity: The current humidity percentage.
Error Handling:

If the city is not found or if there is an error with the API request, the app provides feedback to the user.
User-Friendly Interface:

The use of Streamlit makes the app visually appealing and easy to use, with clear messages indicating success or errors.
